# Algorithm ===> Logarithm 

# alogrithm ===> Set of instructions 

# constant time ===> (O(1)) ===> ideal

# logarithmic time ===> O(log(n)), (3a^2), log2^16 = x, ===> 2^x ==> x = 4 ==> 2^4 = 2x2x2x2 = 16. ===> best 

# linear time ===> O(n) ===> fair

# log-linear ===> O(n log(n)) ===> bad

# quadratic time ===> O(n^2) ===> even bad

# polynomial time ===> O(n^n) ===> even more bad

# exponential time ===> O(2^n) ===> worse

# factorial time ===> O(n!) ===> worst

# factorial time ===> O(n!)
